### **2. Improved Hyperparameters**

**File:** `train_balatro_v2_simple.py`

**Optimized Settings:**
```python
LEARNING_RATE = 0.0005  # Reduced from 0.001
EPSILON_DECAY = 0.995   # Slower decay for better exploration
BATCH_SIZE = 64         # Optimal for stability
MEMORY_SIZE = 10000     # Balanced memory usage
```

### **3. Enhanced Reward Shaping**

**New Reward Function:**
```python
def _calculate_reward(self, action_type: str, result: Any) -> float:
    if self.game_over:
        if self.won:
            return 100.0
        else:
            return -50.0
    
    if action_type == "play":
        score_gained, hand_type = result
        
        # Base reward
        reward = score_gained / 10.0
        
        # Progress bonus - encourage getting closer to target
        progress_bonus = (self.current_score / self.blind_score) * 20
        reward += progress_bonus
        
        # Hand quality bonus
        hand_bonuses = {
            "Royal Flush": 50, "Straight Flush": 30, "Four of a Kind": 20,
            "Full House": 15, "Flush": 10, "Straight": 8,
            "Three of a Kind": 5, "Two Pair": 3, "Pair": 1, "High Card": 0
        }
        reward += hand_bonuses.get(hand_type, 0)
        
        return reward
    
    elif action_type == "discard":
        return -1.0
    
    return 0.0
```

### **4. Improved Network Architecture**

**Simplified DQN Network:**
```python
class SimpleDQN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size: int, action_size: int):
        super(SimpleDQN, self).__init__()
        
        # Smaller network for simplified state space
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, 128)  # Reduced from 256
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 128)         # Reduced from 256
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(128, 64)          # New layer for better representation
        self.fc4 = nn.Linear(64, action_size)
        
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.1)  # Add dropout for regularization
```

### **5. Enhanced Penalties**

**Stricter Invalid Action Penalties:**
```python
# Severe penalty for running out of plays
if self.plays_left <= 0:
    self.game_over = True
    self.won = False
    reward -= 100.0  # Severe penalty for running out of plays

# Penalty for invalid actions
if action_type == "play" and self.plays_left <= 0:
    return self._get_state(), -50.0, True, False, {"error": "No plays left"}

if action_type == "discard" and self.discards_left <= 0:
    return self._get_state(), -50.0, True, False, {"error": "No discards left"}
```
