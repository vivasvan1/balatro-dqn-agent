-- We need to find a way to call HandObserver.observe_hand() at an appropriate time.
-- This could be in a game update function, or when a specific game event occurs (e.g., drawing cards, playing a hand).

-- For now, let's add a placeholder for hooking into the game.
-- We can call init from our lovely.toml patch.
